1) Plan conflict resolver
As a master's student, I want to see exactly which study plan rules are broken and how to fix them, so that I can keep my plan valid without guesswork.

2) Registration task hub
As a student registering for courses, I want a single task list with deadlines and status, so that I do not miss registration windows.

3) Smart course search + plan preview
As a student choosing courses, I want search results to show schedule impact before I add a course, so that I can avoid conflicts early.
